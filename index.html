    <h1>Git Tutorial for Beginners</h1>
        <p>
        Collaborative development of software projects not only happens within companies. Within the open-source sector, several hundred to thousands of volunteers (depending on project size) are involved in maintaining, optimizing, developing or modifying a program. These kinds of projects would be virtually unworkable without a suitable system for recording and managing the numerous changes submitted by different developers.

        <p>
        One of the most popular solutions to version management is the license-free tool Git. It’s easy to learn and free of charge. In this tutorial, we explain the most important Git basics you need to get started with the version management program.

    <h1>What is Git</h1>

        <p>Git is a distributed version control system developed by Linux creator Linus Thorvalds in 2005 and released under the free GNU-GPLv2 license. What’s special about the tool is that, although a central repository exists for each project, all involved users download a local working copy of this directory onto their own working devices. Each of these copies represents a complete backup of the repository, rendering a continuous network connection unnecessary and enabling offline working. Moreover, the copies can be used to restore each project in the event the main repository fails or becomes damaged. Implemented changes can be exchanged with all other project participants at any time and – where relevant – included in the repository.

        <p>One of the best-known alternatives to Git is the tool Subversion which is also an open-source program. It’s better known as SVN and, unlike Git, utilizes a central management system. Read this article "Git vs. SVN – Comparing Version Management Tools“ to learn what commonalities these tools share and how they differ.
